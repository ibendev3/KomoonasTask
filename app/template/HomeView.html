    <h2>Development Document</h2>
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p class="lead">
        Handling with the assignment and it's details was pretty challenging, giving the amount of time, the unfamiliar area of
        web dynamic charts and the large amount of data coming from distanced resource needed to be analyzed at some point. <br/>
        With that said, I had to do some pre-coding research and design. the decisions I took at start has changed with the development but they made the
        assignment clearer.
    <p>

    <h4>Architecture</h4>
    <p class="lead">
        The application is running under <a href="http://nodejs.org/">NodeJS</a> web server, and architect to be a single-page application using the capabilities of
        the front end solution - <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> - taking care of client-side routing, data binding and dynamic events occurring in the page. The visualization charts are being handled by an
        open source library by Google (<a href="https://developers.google.com/chart/">Google Charts</a>) which I chose because after testing few other options(D3, Charts.js) Google's was the easiest to customise to a specific need and
        has to best support with Angular, but still - I'm not 100% sure it's the best solution for a larger application. Look and Feel is with components and styling of <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter-Bootstrap</a> Which I
        find amazing when you need a quick layout and objects on screen.

    <h4>Data flow</h4>
    <p class="lead">The data flow is the following steps:
    <ol class="lead">
        <li>Webserver is stating</li>
        <li>Webserver send a request to the DataSource holding the JSON file</li>
        <li>Data is parsed, analyzed, set to relevant data structures and cached on the server side</li>
        <li>When needed on the page - client call the data from the server (where it cached and minimized)</li>
        <li>Data is injected to the client objects and charts</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <h4>Visualization</h4>
    <p class="lead">The application present 2 pages of different visualization:<br/>
        The first one is the Daily volume - It display a Linear chart of a chosen date and the data displayed compare between
        inited, served and default on every hour of the day. Tag IDs can be filtered or display all.
        <br/> The second one is displaying data regarding strategies used by Komoona algorithms, for a chosen tag it gives a view of
        all strategies attempted and what happened with the requests. here you can filter by amount of requests inited (gives the ability to
        observe on strategies with low usage.


    </p>
    <h4>Pitfall</h4>
    <p class="lead">
        The most challenging pitfall with the assignment was dealing with the data, coming from a distanced source, all at once and need to be structured in a way
        I can "play" with easily once an event is triggered on the page. I think that if I had a control over the data source I would probably load it in chunks of days, though
        that if the historical data is static it only needed to be loaded once when the server launches, and the just adding the offset data every new hour.
        <br/>The second pitfall was choosing and building the environment, At first I wanted to save time so I chose to work on a client side application only, But I wasn't satisfied
        with the performance of the data analytic, So I had to add a server to process the data once and not per request.
    </p>
    <h4>If I had more time?</h4>
    <p class="lead">
    Plenty can be done with extra time. I think that with few more hours i'd clear some areas I'm not satisfied with - Extreme cases check on code, Negative feedback to user when needed, Interactive display on items click.
    With few more days extra charts could be added on both pages, charts that can minimize the scope of the analytics to a specific item that the user choose and I guess that a user management mechanism is the first need, then data can be displayed dynamically according to the user.
